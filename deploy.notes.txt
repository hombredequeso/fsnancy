When using OctoPack:
- install OctoPack package.
- add to fsnancy.fsproj:

  <!-- Manually added to get octopack to build. See https://kzhendev.wordpress.com/2014/07/ -->
<Import Project="..\packages\OctoPack.3.0.41\tools\OctoPack.targets" Condition="Exists('..\packages\OctoPack.3.0.41\tools\OctoPack.targets')" />
